# Regex Phone Number Tutorial

Have you ever heard of regular expressions(regex)? If not, then today you will have the oppurtunity to learn about what regex is and how you can break it down into sections to better understand the purpose of a regular expression.

## Summary

Below is how to create a regular expression for a phone number.
```
/(?:(\+1[ -])\(?(?<areacode>\d{3})\)[ -]?(\d{3})[ -]?(\d{4})/gm
```
At a first glance this might look confusing. So I am going to break this down for you.

## Regex Components

Regex components are a sequence of characters that define the search pattern and there are multiple components of regex. To verify whether a given input is a valid phone number we need to match it with the following Regex to match a phone number id âˆ’ 
```
/(?:(\+1[ -])

\(?(?<areacode>\d{3})\) [ -]?

(\d{3}) [ -]?

(\d{4})/gm"
```
The first Group represents the Country Code for the United States (+1).

The areacode Group represents the area code of the phone number.

The third Group represents the middle three digits of the phone number.

The fourth Group represents the last four digits of the phone number.

## Quantifiers

Quantifiers indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.
I am want to match the three digits in the areacode, the three middle digits, and the ending for digits.
Here is an example of how to 'match' a 10 digit number '9997774444':

```
/\d{10}/
```

They might have dashes in the number like so, '999-777-4444'.
The following syntax supports this.

```
/\d{3}-?\d{3}-?\d{4}/
```

The ? means the dashes are 'optional'. So IF they put the dashes within the phone number or not, it will still match.
